sudo chmod 777 ./EcSimulatorHilDemo

keep EXI file in this folder only

The command "lspci -v" shows which driver is assigned to which network card,

ethernet driver will be something like

01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 15)
.....
Kernel driver in use: r8169

here first you have to unbind this non realtime network driver(acontis ec simulator "Unbind from kernel driver")

$ echo "<Instance-ID>" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/<driver-name>/unbind
Example:
$ echo "0000:01:00.0" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/r8169/unbind

you can find this "0000:01:00.0" in $ ls /sys/bus/pci/drivers/r8169

then install the realtime network driver atemsys

go to /EC-Simulator-HiL-V3.1-Linux-x86_64Bit-Eval/Sources/LinkOsLayer/Linux/atemsys

then
$ make modules

$ sudo insmod atemsys.ko

then restart the system to take network changes into affect

then in /EC-Simulator-HiL-V3.1-Linux-x86_64Bit-Eval/Bin/Linux/x64

$ sudo ./EcSimulatorHilDemo -f acontis_hardware_simulation.xml -rtl8169 1 1 -perf

you will get rtl8169 bcz in acontis ec simulator doc "Unload kernel driver" table shows that 
for kernel r8169, Link Layer Name is emllRTL8169 so rtl8169
if kernel is e1000e, Link Layer Name is emllI8254x so i8254x

acontis ec simulator doc("Link Layer" page 47)

if there were two same ethernet drivers in pc and you want to run ethercat through first one then 

$ sudo ./EcSimulatorHilDemo -f acontis_hardware_simulation.xml -rtl8169 1 1 -perf

if there were two same ethernet drivers in pc and you want to run ethercat through second one then 

$ sudo ./EcSimulatorHilDemo -f acontis_hardware_simulation.xml -rtl8169 2 1 -perf

we have to do

sudo insmod atemsys.ko

everytime we start pc to load this driver. 
we can check if the atemsys is loading properly or not by running "dmesg" in terminal. It should show atemsys v1.4.17 loaded
also lspci -v will show "Kernel driver in use: atemsys_pci" in "Ethernet controller" section
